Why a breakout game?
--------------------

There are many good breakout clones. There are even more bad breakout clones. So why am I writing another? There are a few goals:

 - The first goal is for me to write and complete a game. I've tried several times in the past, and each time I set the score too broad. This time I created a list of what I'd like to implement before the game is done.

 - For me to learn the LŐVE engine. I have never worked with it before, nor really with any other game engines.

 - To get code out there. Because feedback is awesome!


What features have to exist for it to count as done?
